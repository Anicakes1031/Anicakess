                <br><br>
                My name was originally inspired by Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars. However, due to 
                a small mix-up, my parents ended up naming me Aniken instead!

    <b style="font-size: 2rem;">REFINETTE COSMETIC MANUFACTURING CORPORATION</b>
    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; color: white;">I completed my 250-hour internship as 
        a Full Stack Developer at Refinette Cosmetic Manufacturing Corporation, where I 
        had the opportunity <br>to work on various projects that enhanced the company's operational 
        processes. Throughout my internship, I gained hands-on experience <br>in both front-end 
        and back-end development, focusing on designing and optimizing web applications 
        to improve workflow efficiency.<br><br>

        One of the key technologies I worked with was Odoo CRM, which we utilized to 
        streamline business operations, manage customer relationships, <br>and automate internal 
        processes. My role involved customizing and integrating Odoo modules, ensuring that 
        they aligned with the <br>company's specific requirements. Additionally, I worked 
        extensively with Python, the primary language for Odoo development, to build and 
        <br>modify functionalities that enhanced system performance.<br><br>
        
        This internship provided me with valuable insights into enterprise resource planning 
        (ERP) systems and reinforced my problem-solving, <br>collaboration, and software 
        development skills. Working alongside experienced professionals allowed me to 
        deepen my understanding <br>of database management, API integrations, and UI/UX development, 
        further preparing me for a career in the tech industry.</h2>
